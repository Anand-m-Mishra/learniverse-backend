Overview
The learniverse API uses JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for authentication. This documentation explains how the generation and handling of access and refresh tokens take place.

Access Token
The access token is a JSON Web Token (JWT) that is generated when a user logs in. It contains the user's ID, username, and email, and is signed with a secret key.

Generation
The access token is generated using the generateAccessAndRefreshToken function:
This function generates an access token and a refresh token for a user. Here's what it does:

It finds the user by ID in the database.
It generates an access token using the user's details (ID, username, email, etc.).
It generates a refresh token using the user's details.
It saves the refresh token to the user's document in the database.
It returns both the access token and refresh token.

verifyJWT

This function verifies an access token sent in the Authorization header of a request. Here's what it does:

It extracts the access token from the Authorization header.
It verifies the token using a secret key.
If the token is valid, it extracts the user's details from the token and stores them in the req.user object.
It calls the next middleware function in the chain.

generateNewAccessToken

This function generates a new access token using a refresh token. Here's what it does:

It finds the user by refresh token in the database.
If the user is found, it generates a new access token using the user's details.
It returns the new access token.
